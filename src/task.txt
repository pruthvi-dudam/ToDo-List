**Task Description: Todo List Application**

**Objective:**
Build a simple Todo List application using React. The application should allow users to manage a list of tasks, including adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, and deleting tasks.

**Key Features:**
1. **Task List Display:**
   - Display the list of tasks in a clear and organized manner.
   - Each task should show its description and an option to mark it as completed.

2. Add Task Functionality:
   - Include a form or input field where users can add new tasks.
   - When a user enters a new task and submits the form or button, it should be added to the list.

4. Delete Task Functionality:
   - Provide an option (e.g., a delete button) for users to remove a task from the list.
   - Include a confirmation prompt before deleting to prevent accidental deletions. (optional)

5. Task Completion Status:
   - Allow users to mark a task as completed.
   - Visually differentiate between completed and pending tasks.

Implementation Ideas:
- Utilize React state to manage the list of tasks. Each task should be represented as an object with properties like `id`, `description`, and `completed`.
- Use controlled components for form inputs to manage their state.
- Implement functions to handle adding, editing, and deleting tasks, updating the state accordingly.
- Apply conditional rendering to show different UI elements based on the completion status of tasks.
- Consider styling the application for a clean and user-friendly interface.

Bonus Feature (Optional):
- Sorting tasks based on completion status or alphabetical order.
